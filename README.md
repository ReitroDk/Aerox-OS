# Aerox-OS  (Work in Progress)
Aerox OS is a custom Linux distribution based on Debian 13, currently under development. For now, it is just a script that you run after installation.

At the moment, Aerox OS is **not a standalone distribution**. 

***

As you can see, the repository is currently empty. I have created it now purely for **organizational purposes** and to secure the project's space.

A bootable ISO image may be developed in the future once the project is
stable enough.
This will probably take a long time, since this is a one-person project
and there is no team yet.


in **one to two weeks**, I plan to release a **tutorial and a setup script** that you can use on a fresh installation of a Debian "minimal" system. This will allow you to quickly test the system configuration, see if you like it, and use it however you wish.

Update 12/27: The "beta" script is ready; however, it currently only works on 1080p and 720p screens and still contains several bugs. Laptop and desktop compatibility is still under development, but the system should be relatively stable by now.

I’m releasing these notes today because I’m currently restructuring the entire script due to compatibility issues. I still need to write proper documentation for the system. Given the timeframe I previously promised, it may not be possible to release the system in the state I originally intended, so delays are likely.
