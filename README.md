# Aerox-OS  (Work in Progress)
Aerox OS is a custom Linux distribution based on Debian 13, currently under development. For now, it is just a script that you run after installation.

***

As you can see, the repository is currently empty. I have created it now purely for **organizational purposes** and to secure the project's space.

In the coming weeks, the **AEROX OS ISO** (installation image) will likely be available here.

Additionally, in **two to three weeks**, I plan to release a **tutorial and a setup script** that you can use on a fresh installation of a Debian "minimal" system. This will allow you to quickly test the system configuration, see if you like it, and use it however you wish.
